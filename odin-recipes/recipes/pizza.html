            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Store bought pizza dough (about 12-16 oz)</li>
                <li>Pizza sauce (or whatever you might like as a bottom sauce, like pesto or just tomatoes)</li>
                <li>Mozarella chesse (either shredded or large chunks spread around.)</li>
                <li>Vegetable or Meat toppings</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Step 1: Preheat oven to highest it will go.  Usually between 550 and 475 depending on the oven.  If you have a pizza stone, place in the oven to get warm now.</li>
                <li>Step 2: Roll out pizza dough.  Many people use flour, but too much flour can make the dough rough.  I use a light amount of olive oil on the counter and rub it around.</li>
                <li>Step 3: You want to push from the center and push outwards making sure to leave a healthy sized crust.</li>
                <li>Step 4: At this point I like to place the dough onto parchment paper which will make the transfer to the oven much easier.</li>
                <li>Step 5: Top your pizza.  Start with your sauce and spread it all over the dough, leaving a little rim around the edge for the crust.  Then add your cheese, either shredded or large chunks, or both.  Lastly arrange any other topping you might want on your pizza.</li>
                <li>Step 6: Bake the pizza for about 8-12 minutes depending on how thick the crust is. The edges should be golden brown and the cheese should be melty and bubbly.  If you are not using a pizza stone, use a spatula to lift up the pizza to see if the bottom is browning evenly.  If it is still white and doughy, leave it in for a bit longer.</li>
                <li>Step 7: remove pizza from oven and let cool for a couple of minutes.  Slice and enjoy! </li>
            </ol>
