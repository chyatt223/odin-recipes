            <h1>Banana Pancakes</h1>

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>These banana pancakes are a staple at my house.  My kids and my wife love them.  These are completely customizable and can be made to your own tastes.  I will just give a blueprint on how to start.</p>
            <p>The basic ingredients of the pancake are bananas, eggs, oatmeal, and some flour.  I typically will use 3 very ripe bananas.  The more ripe the banana is, the sweeter the pancakes will be.  I tend to make sure the bananas are just beginning to brown, not completely brown.</p>

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>3 ripe bananas</li>
                <li>3 eggs</li>
                <li>1/3 cup rolled oats</li>
                <li>pinch of salt</li>
                <li>pinch of cinammon</li>
                <li>few drops of vanilla (optional)</li>
                <li>chocolate chips or sprinkles (optional)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Step 1: Mash the bananas in a bowl. </li>
                <li>Step 2: Mix in eggs and oats and combine.</li>
                <li>Step 3: add in pinch of salt and cinnamon to taste.</li>
                <li>Step 4: Get frying pan ready over medium heat with a little oil covering bottom of pan. </li>
                <li>Step 5: Add a spoon full of batter to frying pan. Depending on size of pan, you might be able to fit a few at a time.</li>
                <li>Step 6: At this part you can add your chocolate chips or sprinkles to the pancakes on the pan.</li>
                <li>Step 7: Be ready to flip the pancake when you notice little bubble around the edges.</li>
                <li>Step 8: Flip the pancake and wait for the other side to finish, about 1-2 more minutes.</li>
                <li>Step 9: Take them off the pan and repeat with the remaining batter.  Eat with more sliced bananas and maple syrup. Enjoy!</li>
